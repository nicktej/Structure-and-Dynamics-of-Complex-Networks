# Structure-and-Dynamics-of-Complex-Networks
This repository contains projects and labs I worked on for my networks science class at AIT Budapest.
The language used was Python.
Network models I learnt include Erdos-Renyi Model, Barabasi-Albert Model, Configuration Model, Holme-Kim Model, SI Model, etc.
